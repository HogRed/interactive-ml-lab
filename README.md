# Interactive ML Lab – California Housing

This project is a small, interactive machine learning lab built with **Streamlit**.

It walks through:
- Loading real-world data
- Exploratory data analysis
- Model training
- Model evaluation

## How to run

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```

This project is designed as a teaching tool and will continue to grow over time.

## Create a Virtual Environment (strongly recommended)

Still in the VS Code terminal:

### On Windows (PowerShell)

Create the virtual environment:

```powershell
python -m venv venv
```

Activate it:

```bash
.\venv\Scripts\Activate
```

You should now see:

(venv)

in front of your terminal prompt.

## Install the Dependencies

Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This installs Streamlit and everything else locally.

## Run the App

Now launch the app:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

You should see something like:

```text
Local URL: http://localhost:8501
```

Click it — your app should open in the browser!
